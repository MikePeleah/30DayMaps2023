## Daily Notes
### Day 1. Points
I have always been fascinated by the Roman Empire's economy, the sheer size of empire, it complex economic ties. Years ago I visited the [Monte Testaccio (or Monte dei Cocci)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Testaccio) in Rome, a great relic of thie economy, holding remains of an estimated **53 million amphorae**. Hence, I decided to construct a map Roman wine and oil presses sites. I used data available from the [The Olive Oil and Wine Presses Database](https://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/olive_oil_and_wine_presses_database/), compiled by Annalisa Marzano and Miko Flohr for the [Oxford Roman Economy Project](https://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/). For this simple map I used R + ggplot.
